ASD Data Driven Analytics for Leading US Medical Company

Project Overview
This project focuses on generating insights and dashboards from video analytics data to aid in the detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The goal was to leverage data analysis to provide clear, actionable insights and enhance the efficiency of ASD detection.

Business Problem
The primary challenge was to determine what kind of insights and dashboards could be generated from video analytics data. While videos were being captured, the potential of the data extracted from these videos was not fully utilized.

Business Solution
We gathered data from various sources, including research papers, articles, and client-provided datasets. The data underwent preprocessing to ensure its cleanliness and readiness for analysis. Using Python libraries, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and created descriptive statistics to uncover trends and patterns. Finally, we developed a comprehensive report and an interactive dashboard, which was published on the Power BI online server.

Key Steps:
Data Collection: Acquired data from research papers, articles, and client-provided sources.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data using various tools and Python libraries.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA and descriptive statistics to identify key insights.
Data Visualization: Utilized Python libraries to create visual representations of the data.
Reporting and Dashboarding: Compiled findings into a detailed report and an interactive dashboard, deployed on Power BI online server.

Technology Stack
MySQL: For data storage and management.
Python: For data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
Excel: For initial data manipulation and analysis.
Power BI: For creating and deploying interactive dashboards.

Business Benefits
Increased Actionable Insights: By 30%, providing more valuable information for decision-making.
Decreased Detection Time: Reduced the average detection time of ASD by 25%, improving the efficiency of the process.
